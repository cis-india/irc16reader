      <h3><strong>Ten observations and ideas that have informed the design of Open Media Library</strong></h3>
      <p>- Many of our friends are sharing books online. This has worked well for the past 15 years, and has become easier in many ways. At the same time, today's online book sharing infrastructure is astonishingly fragile (think libgen or aaaarg), and too much responsibility rests with too few easily identifiable individuals.</p>
      <p>- We don't want to get (back) into that business.</p>
      <p>- As with other media, like music or movies, the problem today is not: how does in individual X get access to item Y. This has been solved, mostly (modulo place, class, gender, etc). The problem today is: how can the enormous personal or shared archives that have been created in the past 15 years enter some sort of federation of local libraries, and how can the highly autistic practice of personal media archive management feed into something more collaborative, curatorial, and (hopefully) fun.</p>
      <p>- We don't want to create another global peer-to-peer system, since that still requires a centralized discovery service (with our names on it). We'd prefer peers to discover each other: either by "friending" their real-world librarian friends, or even better, by being in the same room (libraries on the same wireless network will automatically discover each other). Beyond that, everyone can see one more hop on the graph (i.e. the peers of their peers), and can choose to peer with them.</p>
      <p>- We've seen with horror everyone's "books" folders, the subfolders, the ones named "unsorted" or "downloaded", the "unknown/more/even more" directory structures. We think that if anyone makes an effort in identifying (i.e. adding basic metadata for) even 5% of this stuff, then no-one should be required to ever do this again. That's why Open Media Library is about sharing metadata, just as much as it is about sharing books.</p>
      <p>- Open Media Library should be entirely legal. Just to make things less complex. At the core of it, it's a local library, something like iTunes. The fact that one can have remote peers is something like a faint memory of the "sharing" feature that iTunes used to have. In this case, it's a bonus, an addition, something everyone can do on their own risk.</p>
      <p>- Of course it's a good thing to minimize this risk. That's one of the reasons for using Tor. Another reason is that there are so few applications that use Tor in an interesting way. And Tor can only become better the more people do with it.</p>
      <p>- Open Media Library is, and will remain for a while, experimental software. That is more than just beta software, more that just "unstable". As an experiment, it can succeed or fail, and while we'd prefer success (by whatever metric - qualitatively is very different from quantitatively), failure would be just as interesting, since it might provide a hint at something better. Most importantly though, the experiment has to be made, practically, by using the software.</p>
      <p>- Open Media Library is, and will remain, free open source software, licenced under the GPL, without any "cloud" or "social" components. The last point is really important, especially in the context of a peer-to-peer application that deals with remote data. It's extremely liberating to design software that is not user-centric. The user, as an argument, is almost always a fraud. Never think of the user.</p>
      <p>- Open Media Library invites software criticism. If you don't know what that is - look it up. It existed, and may still exist. It's similar to film criticism in that it requires the figure of the critic. That's something more than just a movie buff, or nerd, or a blogger. Similarly, software criticism begins with the emergence of a very specific persona, and that's not just a power user or a software enthusiast or a media theorist, even though he or she may come from any of these positions. Either way, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
